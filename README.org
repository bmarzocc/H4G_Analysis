** Categorization training (Per mass point full Run2 training)
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Signal and background ntuples are split into even and odd events. Ntuples containing the odd events are used for training and even events are used for evaluating the BDT and for signal modeling.

The splitting is done via script:

The samples used in training are:
