* BDT Training
A full run2 per mass point training is performed. The signal and datamix samples are split into odd and even events. Training is performed using odd events and evaluated on even events.

** Splitting of events
The splitting is done via [[https://github.com/wamorkart/H4G_Analysis/blob/main/BDTTraining/SplitEvents/split_Tree.py][this]] script.
It is faster to submit jobs on condor. That can be done via [[https://github.com/wamorkart/H4G_Analysis/blob/main/BDTTraining/SplitEvents/split_Tree_Condor.py][this]] script.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
This script can be run locally: python split_Tree.py -i input_file.root -d tagsDumper/trees
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Evaluation of BDT
Change the weight file and the input, output directories [[https://github.com/wamorkart/H4G_Analysis/blob/main/BDTTraining/runApplyCatBDT_Condor.py#L100-#L104][here]]. Then run the following steps:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
voms-proxy-init --voms cms --valid 168:00
python runApplyCatBDT_Condor.py
After checking that the arguments.txt and run_scripts.sh make sense, you are ready to launch condor jobs.
